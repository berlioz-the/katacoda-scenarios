You can proceed to next step as soon as you see **BERLIOZ ENVIRONMENT IS READY** message in the terminal.

While this is happening you can also setup the environment on your computer by following the scenarios:
* MacOS: https://www.katacoda.com/berlioz/scenarios/install-on-mac
* Windows: https://docs.berlioz.cloud/installation/windows
* Ubuntu: https://docs.berlioz.cloud/installation/ubuntu
