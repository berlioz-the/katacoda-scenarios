In this scenario, you will learn key concepts of Berlioz. 

## Key Concepts
* **Cluster**: Clusters represent a logical group of services and native cloud resources that are deployed and managed as a single entity.
* **Service**: Service specifies an executable entity. For service entities it is required a Dockerfile to be in the same directory as the Berliozfile. This enables automatic build and deployment of all docker images within the project.
* **Deployment**: A Deployment provides isolated environment for your application.

This scenario will help you learn those concepts in details.
